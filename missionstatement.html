            This mural was designed by Halle Cooper in consultation with Erin Genia (Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate/Odawa), and created through a collaboration between Keeley Bombard, Ty Furman from The BU Arts Initiative, Orpheo Speer (Tewa/Apache/Din√©) from the BU Community Service Center, the BU Environmental Student Organization, and the Boston Chapter of The Urban Gardening Initiative. Members of these groups and of the greater Boston community painted the mural in April 2022.
            <br>
            Our mural emphasizes the universal patterns that exist among and between nature and humanity. Originally, we planned to highlight human destruction of the environment. But art can transform understandings, and the creative process revealed that the heart of what we were drawn to was interconnectedness, not destruction. We have the ability to foster intentional, sustainable relationships with nature. We came to understand that in many ways this concept is rooted in Indigenous values regarding environmentalism, presenting clear parallels to how our campus was built on Indigenous land. 
            <br>   
            We recognize that the Boston University community benefits from the ongoing history of Indigenous dispossession, and students at this institution want to engage meaningfully with this reality. Art is a powerful communication tool that we hope can lead to lasting relationships between BU students and Indigenous communities.
